tank game made with SFML

========== COMPILING on Win32 ==========
You need
	* CMake >= 2.4
	* UnxUtils (Native Win32 ports of some GNU utilities)
	* TDM-GCC/MinGW compiler & environment.
	* SFML-2.x static libraries and headers (with compatible exception system: either SJLJ or DW2)
	* OpenGL headers (comes in standard with TDM-GCC)
******** defining environment variables ********
Put TDM-GCC and CMake bin directories in the PATH as well as UnxUtils bin directory.
Set the SFML_ROOT environment variable to the SFML directory so that %SFML_ROOT%/lib and %SFML_ROOT%/include directories contain libraries and headers.
Copy the FindSFML.cmake file you got with SFML-2.x archive into the CMake Modules directory. This directory should be in the share/cmake-2.x/Modules subdirectory of the CMake install directory.

************* Building *******************
Now, run this command:
$ mkwin.bat

It should automatically invoke cmake in debug mode to generate MinGW makefiles.
Then, it should auto-generate keys.cpp (this requires the SFML_ROOT environment variable to be defined).
Then, it should invoke the MinGW make command.

************** Explanation **************
FindSFML.cmake allows CMake to find the SFML library & headers, but requires the SFML_ROOT environment variable to be set.
Moreover, SFML_ROOT is used by the generate_keys.cpp.sh script to find the Keyboard.hpp, Joystick.hpp and Mouse.hpp SFML headers in order to auto-generate keys.cpp.
*********** Alternative way *************
Rather than setting SFML_ROOT, you may  get the pkg-config.exe program, set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to a pkgconfig directory, and store a sfml-all.pc file containing the SFML paths.
Of course, you should be familiar with pkg-config and pc files.

============== COMPILING on GNU/Linux ==============
You need
	* CMake >= 2.4
	* GCC
	* SFML 2.x with libraries and headers. Just compile it from source!
	* OpenGL headers (mesa-common-dev package on Ubuntu)
	* fontconfig2 headers (libfontconfig1-dev on Ubuntu)

Now, run these commands:
$ cmake .
$ make
$ ./tankfighter

You are done!
