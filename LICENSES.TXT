tankfighter (c) André Gillibert 2013

tankfighter is released in REALLYFREE license.
Every file that is not marked with another license is implicitly in WTFPL license.
It uses the SFML library in zlib/png license, but does not include any of its code.
It includes a MIT code taken from the SOIL (Simple OpenGL Image Library) library in the src/image_helper.c file.
Since the SOIL library is globally released in "Public Domain" by Jonathan Dummer, I assume this file is also released in public domain. In that case, the MIT license clauses are not binding.

Consequently, you should keep the MIT license text in source and binary distributions, if that the code is not really in public domain.
You don't have to keep the SFML license text in source or binary distributions, but I did it for politeness purposes.

Passed this small constraints, you are free to do anything you want with the software.

Text of these licenses are in files LICENSE-JONATHAN-MIT.TXT, LICENSE-REALLYFREE.TXT and LICENSE-SFML.TXT
